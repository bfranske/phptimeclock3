The PHPTimeClock program was originally hosted on SourceForge. The development team stopped publishing it there and the last version published at SourceForge was phptimeclock-2.0.0rc2.zip on January 6, 2010. The team continued to publish open source versions at phptimeclock.com which eventually became timeclockfusion.com. The last version made available for download was version 3.0.3 on November 23, 2010 though the software is still developed as a hosted application.

Because it's not easy to find the last open source version (3.0.3) and it has been removed from the timeclockfusion.com site I have decided to upload it here. I am not intending to continue to develop it, if someone else is interested in doing so (note the non-standard open source license though) please feel free to contact me and/or fork the project.
